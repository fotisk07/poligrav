# Poligrav

Poligrav is a collection of simple scripts that simulate political models. These scripts let you explore how political opinions evolve over time using fun, interactive simulations.

## Getting Started

### What You Need
- **Python** (version 3.6 or later)
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **tqdm**

That's it! If you have Python installed, you're good to go.

### How to Run the Scripts

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**  
   Get all the files onto your computer.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   Navigate to the folder where the files are located.

3. **(Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
   This step is optional but recommended if you want to keep the project dependencies separate.

   - **Create the Virtual Environment:**  
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - **Activate the Virtual Environment:**  
     - On **Windows:**
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On **macOS/Linux:**
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - **Install Dependencies:**  
     With the virtual environment activated, run:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     This will install **numpy** and **matplotlib**.

4. **Run the Scripts**  
   Poligrav comes with two scripts:

   - **simple_evolution.py**  
     Simulates opinion evolution in a high-dimensional space and tracks an alignment metric.  
     To run it:
     ```bash
     python alignment_evolution.py
     ```
     The script runs the simulation and saves a graph in the `results` folder.

   - **population_party_study.py**  
     Studies the effects of different population sizes and party sizes on opinion convergence.  
     To run it:
     ```bash
     python population_party_study.py
     ```
     This script also saves a graph in the `results` folder showing the evolution of the alignment metric.

5. **View the Results**  
   Open the graphs saved in the `results` folder to see how the opinions evolve and how different parameters affect convergence.

## Have Fun!

No technical expertise is neededâ€”just run the scripts and explore the visualizations. Feel free to tweak the parameters in the code to see how different models behave.

Happy exploring!
